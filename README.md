My first repo

I'm Sammie! I competed in FIRST Robotics for 6 years and still coach a world class team in Eagle. FIRST pretty much runs my life, and I'm totally fine with that :D I got a full ride scholarship from the Department of Defense and will now serve the next 2 summers and 3 years after graduation working at Hanscom Air Force Base in Boston, MA.
